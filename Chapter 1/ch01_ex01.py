A simple text-based game (script) - select a hut where Sir Foo can rest.

This module is compatible with Python 3.5.x. It contains
supporting code for the book, Learning Python Application Development,
Packt Publishing.

The is a simple command line script where the player input a hut number
to 'enter a hut'. Depending on the occupant, the player either
wins or loses! In the aforementioned book this is also referred to as
"Attack of the Orcs v0.0.1". More details can be found in the relevant
chapter of the book..

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
--------------------
- Python 3.5.x must be installed on your system.
- It is assumed that you have Python 3.5 available in your environment
  variable PATH. It will be typically available as 'python' or 'python3'.
- Here is the command to execute this code from command prompt

        $ python ch01_ex01.py     ( OR $ python3 ch01_ex01.py)

- See the README file for more information. Or visit python.org for OS
  specific instructions on executing Python from a command prompt.

TODO:
1. The code comments and function descriptions in this file are
   intentionally kept to a minimum! See a later chapter of the book to
   learn about the code documentation and best practices!
   Feel free to add documentation after reading that chapter.
   Description of the code can be found in the book.

It is quite simple to make this code compatible even with Python 2.7.9
as follows. This is not used as this script is intended to be a very simple
Python illustration.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For backward compatibility with Python 2.7.9
# Python 2.x, the built-in function 'input' is equivalent to
# eval(raw_input(prompt)). So we should use just raw_input instead.
# Also note that we are importing print_function from module __future__
# for the same reason (see the first line of this file)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_input_function = None

if sys.version_info < (3, 0):
    user_input_function = raw_input
else:
    user_input_function = input

# Then call user_input_function() in places where we call input()
